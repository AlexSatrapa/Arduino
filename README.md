# Alex's Arduino Projects

Herein are a collection of Arduino projects combined with a Makefile that allows command-line operation of the Arduino compiler chain.

The pins.h file contains the list of standard pins for Arduino and Leonardo devices (mine is set up for the Freetronics LeoStick), including which interrupts and standard peripherals are attached to which pins.

The script "newproject" will create a new folder, copy the template files into that project, leaving an environment ready for you to start writing code.

Feel free to contact me via email if you have questions or suggestions. I don't claim to know what I'm doing, but hopefully I can find and answer for you!
