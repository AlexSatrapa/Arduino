/**
 * \class BlinkLED BlinkLED.h <BlinkLED.h>
 * \brief Blink a LED on a digital output pin.
 *
 * BlinkLED simplies the process of blinking a LED by encapsulating the
 * control logic into a single class.  The following example strobes the
 * status LED on D13 with a period of 70 milliseconds on, 930 milliseconds off
 * (the LED is initially off):
 *
 * \code
 * #include <BlinkLED.h>
 *
 * BlinkLED statusBlink(13, 70, 930);
 *
 * void setup() {}
 *
 * void loop() {
 *     statusBlink.loop();
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The current state() of the LED can be changed immediately by calling
 * setState().  The blink rate can be modified with setBlinkRate().
 * And the blink cycle can be suspended and restarted with pause()
 * and resume().
 */
