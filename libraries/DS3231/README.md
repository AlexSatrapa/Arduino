# DS3231 Interface

The DS3231 module was originally written by [Seeed Technology Inc](http://www.seeedstudio.com) and used
in Seeeduino Stalker v2.1 for battery management (MCU power saving mode) & to generate timestamp for data logging. DateTime Class is a modified version supporting day-of-week.

[Original DateTime Class][JLRTC] and its utility code is by Jean-Claude Wippler at JeeLabs.
